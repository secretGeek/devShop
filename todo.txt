# TODO

[ ] person emojis -- emoji skin tone modifiers would be good see https://emojipedia.org/modifiers/ -- i TRIED + ("🤔" + "\u200B" + "🏾") and ("🤔" + "&zwj;" +"🏾"); no luck yet -- and same without the zwj at all... no luck!

//TODO: Some items can only be purchased if you have the necessary target.
  // e.g. advanced developer training requires a dedicated developer (not just the founder)

[ ] BUY button ....

Thomas ideas:

A few ideas

**definitely**

- Change request event, like the current bug event, which pulls a card from its current position, even finished, back to start.
--> difference is, it is an added story, not a recycled story, it takes BA time, it doesn't have a money decrease, but rather an increase.... although it does delay the completion bonus. Has different symbology/description. (How to trigger it, without worrying about a race condition regarding completion bonus?)

- Special abilities which you unlock over time and obtain charges of in some way, purchasing or as rewards, such as Bug Bash to rapidly get through a stack of bugs, or Mercenary which brings in a high-level super contractor for a single sprint.

--> bug bash... like a bonus round
--> 

- Occasional Tenders, which are like boss fights compared to normal projects. You have to put together the tender somehow, perhaps it's like a normal project but instead of rewarding money it rewards a tender application score that determines whether you win the tender. The tender itself is then a bigger more challenging version of a project with better rewards.

--> a tender item pays no money along the way, and only pays money if you win the tender and complete the project, but the project pays a premium (to make up for the tender cost)


** time management ideas **

if it was implemented as a time management system then there would be little modal tasks  that pop up

for example to create cards:

	As a ..... <role>
	I want a ..... <thing >
	So that. <benefit>

where role:=
	User
	Sophisticated user
	Teacher
	
	Adjective-profession or role
	
	People win chess
	Astronauts solve problem 
	Life becomes wonderful


When there's Code to be written 

	—- Tao tap tap -- code gets written
	
Front end to be tested....

		tap each element -- see if a bug emerges...

Bugs to be fixed

	Front end - tap each bug
	Code - tap each bug 


**probably not**

- At the end of each project you choose a go live party option (random multiple activities with different costs), the option you pick determines the morale boost each employee gets in the first sprint of the next project.

- Adding complexity to above: each employee has activities they like (extra boost) and dislike (no boost).


- Traits for employees, so when choosing employees to hire you have to balance their salary, traits and current level. For example devs can have a Cowboy trait that increases dev speed but also bug chance. No stats like Game Dev Story, an employee just has a level and their traits.

NO: only one dog in the office.
No: only one cat in the office.

No: cat poops
No: dog poops
No: rename to 'tinykanban'



# DEFER
stats button lower right 📈 : each person's skills and description. point per minute described for every minute of the game (excluded minutes with 0 points)

show scores and levels in hexadecimal????

[ ] achievement when a thing is done for the first time?


store game state in local storage


## Defer/Maybe

[ ] Cumulative flow diagrams
[ ] ability to re-arrange workers
[done] How to do determine if a job has become too stale? has taken too long to complete? and if determind, how to show it visually?
[done] Self-start... also randomly fire if unallocated for too long.
[done] Dark mode
[done] drawMessage "You gave Alan a developer upgrade" 
[ ] drawMessage "Founder is enjoying that donut"
[ ] StoreItem: Master BA: breaks a project into two smaller projects. (applies if the project size > half of the current points per project level)
     calls them {original name} A and {original name} B.
     can only be given to a person once. (How to do selection/highlighting?)
[no](buy bot instead) Hire a scrum master... once you hire them -- they take over for you, basically... and you can then open a second DevShop...
[ ] how to show attributes/stats sheet of a person? (see stats button)
? limited number of slots for people. cannot hire more than level number... until 
? dual-skill cannot be better than "4/5" at either skill
finesse:
- buy dev button is visible but disabled is < (cost of dev)
- if no activity detected for long time... show tip
- non-prop font for level etc.



## Won't do

no: Personal robot 🤖: ?? If I had a good use for the robot, then yes. But can't see one. Maybe adds level 1 to all?
no: add a random timer of sick/vacation unavailability for each resource -- although "realistic" this is a model not reality, it's okay to avoid most of reality. I feel it would be painful. I also thought about having them spontaneous quit but avoided it. Same with managing their moods/energy levels. Nah, too detailed.
no: resources gain experience/competence with each task they finish -- too nuanced. not able to be shown visually.
no: A worker sometimes gets distracted. (Often). -- the dog/cat might decrease that.
no: When you add something to the board. If it's the only thing on the board, then select that thing automatiucally.
no: button hover should be light blue
no: do we have an id issue when selecting storeitem's in store versus inbox? clash of id's?
no: test-management suite -- test level up
no: powerful IDE -- dev level up
no: spreadsheet skills -- be a better BA
no: email etiquette course -- be a better BA
no: when you buy a self-starter card (or any card) that should not be enough to kick off the self-starting behaviour. (or should it!?) (yes it should)
no: Add icons to columns to make required skill clearer (tried it, couldn't make it work neatly on small mobile screens)
no: Limit dog/cat numbers
no: chain observations onto each self start. REMOVING observation
no: are observations now chained with self-start? seems too extreme. REMOVING observation



# DONE

* Selecting the buy bot:
  [x] Must be assigned to someone who has initiative. No: I just give the person minimum initiative
  [x] If selected from inbox and no one possible to assign: a display message will explain why no target recipients. No, see above.
[x] emoji font not used for message areas - 🖼 doesn't look right
[x] show # 📍 -- points in the column labels.
[x] robot 🤖 buy-bot: robo-caller -- A robot at your desk! The buy-bot buys new projects for you (unless the backlog is over its limit) 
[x] only 1 buy bot allowed. 
[x] Buying the buy bot...... 
   [x] it does not refresh the display right away
   [x] it says "out of stock is not available until a higher level"
[x] select skill from inbox, a worker is highlighted. but when their initiative ticks over, they lose their highlight.


[x] all dogs have same icon after first choice (no, there just weren't enough icons for dogs, so i broadened by canine definition)
[x] move initiative up.
[x] have starting initiative be much much slower ??
[x] bugs repeat too much in early levels when you only have 1/2 people. A re-cycled card should have less and less chance of having new bugs. 
[x] start button
[x] load button (Or replace 'load' with 'resume' and have it say "12 🥑 153 🥓" .. and perhaps a time you last opened it??)
[x] exit load screen
[x] about button
[x] exit about
[x] mailing list controls
[x] donut machine 🏭 - similar effects to coffee machine. Doesn't seem advisable though.
[x] cards and projects age. After X minutes, they are worth 0. progress bar along the side.
[x] show 💲/min
[x] things in the done column should always appear faded out like their busy, but basically unselectable
[x] When person returns from completing a self-started task, they should highlight themselves if there is a selected object of consequence
[x] dog: consistent icon (random choice at first)
[x] dog to have a name
[x] cat: consistent icon (random choice at first)
[x] cat to have a name 
[x] Add to store: 
[x] headphones 🎧 
[x] Desk plant 🌳
[x] Desk cactus 🌵
[x] cookie 🍪 ($1, not unlocked until level 100)
[x] for dev/ba/test: If level > 9 -- use infinity symbol not a number
[x] if person is the selected doer then they cannot self-start at that moment.
[x] Dogs, cats and store items shouldn't count towards number of items in column, only stories.
[x] cat nerd doesn't render correctly (on iOS at least)

[x] remove observation skill
[x] rename self-start to initiative
[x] Self-starter -- should be infinite but with a big delay. Delay is smaller at higher levels.
[x] 🐛when in the store: only store messages should be shown
[x] tending to cat/dog takes too long as you progress.
[x] keyboard icon not rendered correctly when added to person 'has' -- add .icon class
[x] level of observation training should be shown....
[x] level of self-starter behaviour should be shown...
[x] indicate # items in a column if more than a minimum
[x] help button doesn't work
[x] slower increase in cost for store items.
[x] ensure chance of CREATING a bug or spec bug is lower for rework
[x] ensure level of skills is visible
[x] icon to indicate has seat after seat upgrade: should show up on the person
[x] seat upgrade should make you more effective
[x] chance of finding a bug or specBug -- need to be same mathematical model as creating bug or spec bug
[x] if > 1, show skill level number top right of skill icon on person card.
[x] consider: the store should show level n+1 items, disabled.
[x] show next level items (disabled) before they are available (buttons in office, and in store)
[x] when new items added to store, show a little icon on the store button
[x] highlight store button to indicate when there are new things added to it. Unhighlight it when it is pressed.
[x] highlight button when enabled -- do this for all buttons that are created during level up. (e.g. buy dev)
[x] ability to see skill level
[x] dog/cat never seem to return!
[x] there is a 0% chance of finding it (spec bug)
[x] starting price of tester and dev should be 200 not 300
[x] add "piece of toast 🍞 $10"
[x] BA retained message after stopping rework on a specbug
[x] ensure Dog and cat are for "any" not just "ba" or "dev"
[x] every time you buy something it triples in price. Better idea! Not triple, but high price.
[x] store... put ICON before name
[x] Add  statue 🗽
[x] Add   statue2 🗿
[x]  mechanical keyboard should be an early level item -- level up anyone
[x] When a .button is clicked at top, deselect doer or receiver and possible 
[x] mech keyboard should be added
[x] Price of staff should double each time. At least. If not 5x. Or 3x 

Memory management:
 When a project is complete:
   [x] Delete each of its stories from game.stories
   [x] Delete it from projects. 
[x] Initial dog cat duration double
[x] And double it every time there after 
[x]If money is negative then XP is not added to XP. Instead it is multiplied by -1 and added to money
[x] And lock in the per point price of the story (lead) when it is purchased then pass it into the children when. They are spawned. 
[x] When the customer finds a bug... the return of the card is immediately halved.



[x] Don't say idle if they are just waiting to self start
[x] Show self start icon 


[x] Shouldn't be able to select items that are in the done column
[x] instead of efficiency... have their skill level map so 1-10 is 0.3  0.4  ,0.5   ,0.6   ,0.77   ,0.83  ,0.90   ,0.95  ,0.99

[x] if have cat... less errors.
[x] if have dog... work faster.
 [x]  is there inflation?
		each time a thing is purchased, that thing becomes x% more expensive. i.e. compounding interest on prices.
	levels:
		each time an action is performed, you receive an experience point.
		? the person also receives an experience point for that skill.

[x] guillotine bug on iOS (table too tall basically)
[x] bugs can exist before level 2 - just can't be found by tester or customer (avoids a way of cheating/missing the point)
[x] rework on a bug should be quicker than original work.
[x] button text smaller, particularly at smaller sizes
[x] vertical-center content in .button
[x] store items should have an info icon that reveals their description.
[x] bugs don't exist until level 2...
[x] store: buy observation skills. 
[x] replace 'var ' with 'let '
[x] bug: shouldn't be able to select a 'busy' receiver or doer.
[x] when something is selected and it's wrong then de-select the previous thing. (be it doer or receiver)
[x] Board height should be limited.
[x] short series of tool tips for showing/hiding "next action"
		- start the game
		- buy a sales lead
		- click the founder, then click the lead (or vice versa).
		- click the founder then click a story

[x] when to show "buy person" button(s) ? When money first reaches minimum...

[x] select names from an array
[x] updating person: update card in place, don't remove.
[x] restore delay time factor. (avgDuration)

[x] when someone is busy, say what they are doing. (could be creative later.)
[x] give people names

[x] if something is delivered that has a bug... the customer finds it and gives it back... to be started over. gets angry customer icon.
[x] when developing, chance of finding a bug should be related to: 1. presence of bug, effectiveness of worker.
[x] when developing, chance of *creating* a bug should be related to: effectiveness of worker, size of card.

[x] each project... should also have a project logo. (random emoji)
	[x] that logo is displayed on its lead and subsequent stories
[x] instead of random time to move things... have it relate to # points / effectiveness of worker.
[x] project names could be generated using an algo. ()-().
[x] show the cash amount.
[x] when person is busy show that they are busy
[x] when person is busy they cannot be selected for task
[x] when task is busy it cannot be selected as receiver
[x] when things are 'done' they are delivered... get cash as a result. (Every time! not only when project is completed)
	[x] dollar is shown next to card... it dissappears off board after a few seconds. at which time money appears on board.
 ?  how do leads arrive? randomly? via advertising?
		[x] you buy them.
[x] top align cards in columns.


Answered/resolved (in a different topic)
// ? when purchasing a project... cannot go more than $100 * level into the red (?) or 100* #people ??
// ? When is interest added to the loan!?
//    after a certain amount of time.... (is it a turn based game or a time-based game?)
//      some things about it are time based... delays for example
//    whenever levelling up... whenever a story is finished? whenever an action occurs
